# mml-ms2mml
Turns .mml files from 3MLE's MapleBeats into .ms2mml files

## Note
This is designed purely to transfer 3MLE's MapleBeats's mmls into .ms2mml files that are readable by MapleStory 2. Other files may not work as intended.

## Prequisites
To run this, please download nodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Click here to goto the nodeJS download page").

## Usage
First download the files from the this git repository by cloning or otherwise. </br>
Then open a command line in the root folder and run </br>
```node index.js "<directory to mml file>"``` </br>
The result will be output to the root directory with the same file name (assuming there is only one fullstop in your file name.)
